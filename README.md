# murder-sim 
A very simple and basic murder simulator
## How to use
1. Locate the World.xml file which should be in Murder/Xml
2. You start off with creating a location in the world and slowly add things (inventory, items, etc.) into the location. The location you have the player in is where the game will start at! All very simple. 
3. Compile murder-sim and play!
